\frametitle {Robustness of Block Prediction Methods}

\begin{itemize}
\item BLUP is non-parametric
\item REML are estimating equations, so covariance estimation is non-parametric
\item Predictions are robust to mis-specification of covariance model
\item Both predictor and predictand are linear combinations, so we can appeal to a correlated version of central limit theorem and use normal-distribution for probability statements (e.g., prediction intervals).
\end{itemize}
